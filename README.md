# OCaml-Lexical-Dynamic-Semantics-Implementation
Completed a program implementing a lexical and a dynamic semantic implementation in OCaml for a course learning some programming theory basics

The semantics used is a matter of design and many implementions could be appropriate. While most programming languages today use lexical scope, languages like R do provide ways to bypass it and behave in ways that may be preferred ad hoc. For larger programs, nevertheless, neglecting lexical scope would result in bugs, helping us understanding why modern languages stick to this approach out of the box.
